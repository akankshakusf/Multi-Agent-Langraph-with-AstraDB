# 🏢 AI-Powered Multi-Agent RAG with AstraDB & Wikipedia Search  

## 🔥 Why Enterprises Need This  

Today's organizations **generate massive unstructured data**—emails, PDFs, research papers, compliance documents, and internal reports. However, **90% of this data remains unread and unutilized** due to a lack of efficient retrieval mechanisms.  

This project solves that problem with an **AI-driven, multi-agent retrieval system** powered by **AstraDB (Cassandra-based vector storage) and Wikipedia Search**, enabling enterprises to:  
✅ **Instantly access** relevant insights from corporate data.  
✅ **Analyze millions of unread documents** in seconds.  
✅ **Combine private & public knowledge** seamlessly.  
✅ **Enhance decision-making** with AI-driven retrieval.  

### **🚀 The Future of AI-Powered Search in Enterprise**  
Traditional databases fail to handle **semantic search** effectively. Instead of manually tagging documents, we **convert all knowledge into embeddings** and store them in **AstraDB**, a scalable **vector database**.  

- **🔹 Replace Vector Store with Enterprise Data Lakes**  
  - Enterprises store **billions of raw documents** in **data lakes (AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage)**.  
  - These files are often **unstructured and inaccessible** to traditional SQL queries.  
  - Using this approach, companies can **convert documents into vector embeddings** and **store them in AstraDB or any vector database**.  
  - AI agents can then **retrieve the most relevant context within seconds**, reducing **manual research hours to milliseconds**.  

- **🔹 Agents as Intelligent Knowledge Workers**  
  - A **retrieval agent** queries AstraDB first.  
  - If no relevant data is found, the agent **autonomously routes the query** to external sources like Wikipedia or enterprise APIs.  
  - This eliminates **blind spots** and ensures access to **both private & public knowledge**.
